# PHP & MySQL Login System — Self-Built and Documented

This project is a hands-on attempt to build a basic login and registration system using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. I'm learning backend development by implementing authentication, session logic, and database integration from scratch.

The goal is not just to build a working system, but to understand every part — from how form data moves through PHP to how MySQL stores user credentials securely. This repo will reflect my growth, setbacks, breakthroughs, and everything in between.
